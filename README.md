# TwitterMessagingEngine
Initial project for 330 Software Engineering class in which a set of classes process Twitter-like messages. Unit tests are included as well.
## Details
Developing a set of classes to process Twitter-like messages and writing unit tests to show that the code works.
Tweet Guidelines:
* no more than 280 characters
* "#" can have any alphanumeric characters after it
* "#" cannot have "#" after it, otherwise it will not be recognized as a "tagged" element
  * ex. if ##hello is tweeted, Twitter would only register the second # and the "hello" following it as a part of the tag
* blank spaces separate tags
* "#" cannot have "@" as a part of its tag since @ is used to mention persons or other accounts
* "@" and "#" are the only metacharacters that have special meanings to them
